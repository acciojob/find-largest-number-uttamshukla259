### Complete the FindLargest function that uses relational operators to determine the largest number out of three given numbers without using the `Math.max()` function.

Acceptance Criteria:

- When three numbers are provided, the function should correctly identify and return the largest number among them.
- If two or more of the numbers are equal and are the largest, the function should return any one of them.
- If two or more of the numbers are equal and are not the largest, the function should not return them.
- The function should work for negative and positive numbers, as well as zero.

### Note: The online judge can distinguish whether the `Math.max()` method is used or not.
